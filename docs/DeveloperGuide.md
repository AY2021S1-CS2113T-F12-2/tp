## 1. Introduction
**AniChan** is a command-line application written in **Java 11**. It is written using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm which provides us with means to structure a software program into organized, reusable and reusable pieces of code that makes it good for future improvements and revisions.

### 1.1 Purpose

This content of this guide is aimed at current and new developers of AniChan. It contains the basic steps to set up a development environment, organize your source code, and then build and test AniChan. This guide also aids developers in understanding the overall architecture design and lays out the current implementation details of our notable features with the rationale and considerations behind each one.

### 1.2 Using this Guide
The content of this developer guide is aimed at both current and new developers who are keen on contributing to AniChan. The guide will contain the basic steps to using AniChan to set up a development environment, organize your source code, and then build and test your application. This developer guide is an essential tool that will introduce you to the various features and design concepts which you can use to further develop and maintain AniChan.

## 2. Setting Up
### Setting up the project in your computer

Ensure that you have the following installed: 
* JDK 11.
* IntelliJ IDE (highly recommended).

Firstly, **fork** this repo and **clone** a copy into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA: 
1. **Ensure IntelliJ is configured to use JDK 11**.
    1. Click on `Configure` > `Structure for New Projects` > `Project Settings` > `Project`, 
       and ensure the `Project SDK` is using **JDK 11**.
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**.
    1. Click on `Import Project` and locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
    2. If asked, choose to `Open as Project` (not `Open as File`).
    3. Click `OK` to accept the default settings but do ensure that the selected version of `Gradle JVM` matches the JDK being used for the project.
    4. The import process could take a few minutes to finish.
3. **Verify the setup**: 
    1. Run the `seedu.anichan.Main` and try a few commands. 
    2. You may want to refer to our [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for the list of commands.

### Before writing code
1. **Configuring the coding style**

    If using IDEA, follow this guide 
    [IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) 
    to setup IDEA’s coding style to match ours.

2. **Set up CI**

    There is no set up required as the project comes with a GitHub Actions config files, 
    located in `.github/workflows` folder. When GitHub detects these files, it will run the CI for the project
    automatically at each push to the master branch or to any PR.

3. **Learn the design**

    When you are ready to start writing codes, 
    we recommended that you have a look at AniChan's overall design 
    by reading about it at [AniChan's architecture](DeveloperGuide.md#31-architecture).

<br/>

## 3. Design 

The following section describes the architecture design of **Anichan**. This section starts off by looking at the overall architecture design in a general view, before going into the specific implementation details of the individual features.

### 3.1 Architecture
This section will help provide insight to the general overview of Anichan’s architecture.

<br/>

![Architectural Diagram](images/Architectural-Class-Diagram.png)

*Figure 1: Architecture Diagram*

|---------------|:------------------------|

The **Architecture Diagram** presented above explains the high-level design of AniChan, and given below is a quick overview of each component involved.

The `Main` class is the starting point of the application and has only one class called `Main`, it is responsible for, 
* At launch: Initializes the various components in the correct sequence, connects them up with each other, and loads any saved data.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes any clean up methods where necessary.

The rest of AniChan consists of 6 components: 
- `Ui`: Manages the user interface of AniChan.
- `Parser`: Parses the user input.
- `Command`: Executes the command.
- `User`: Manages the workspace(s) and user data.
- `AnimeData`: Provides data from the anime source file.
- `StorageManager`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

<br/>

Below is an overall sequence diagram to help illustrate the general program flow and how the different objects interact with each other.

### 3.2 UI Component
![UI Component Diagram](images/Ui-Class-Diagram.png) <br/>
*Figure 3: UI Component Diagram*

The UI component consists of a `UI` class that handles all user input and system output. The UI is only dependent on the `Main` class and does not interact directly with other classes ensuring high cohesiveness and separation of roles.

The `Ui` component listens for: 
*  the execution of commands to print the result of the Command.
* any exceptions thrown to show an error message to the user, instead of a program termination.

<br/>

### 3.3 Parser Component
![Parser Component Diagram](images/Parser-Class-Diagram.png) <br/>
*Figure 4: Parser Component Diagram*

The `Parser` component consists of a `Parser` class and multiple `XYZParser` each representing a specific command’s parser. The Parser class will first receive a user command from `Main` and will proceed to determine the command type.

Once the command type is known, it will then create the respective `XYZParser` class.

Example: If Browse command was parsed, `Parser` will create `BrowseParser`.

`XYZParser` will then parse the parameter and perform input validation, before creating the Command object to return to `Main`.

<br/>

### 3.4 Command Component
![Command Component Diagram](images/Command-Class-Diagram.png)
*Figure 5: Command Component Diagram*

The `Command` component consists of different commands represented together as `XYZCommand` which all inherits from the abstract `Command` class. 

Example: The Browse command would be represented by a `BrowseCommand`.

`Main` would utilise the `Command.execute` operation to carry out the execution of the command and retrieve a String output that will contain the successful result of the `Command`. If the `Command` was not successful an exception will be thrown with details of the failure.

<br/>

### 3.5 AnimeData Component
![AnimeData Component Diagram](images/AnimeData-Class-Diagram.png)
*Figure 6: AnimeData Component Diagram*

The `AnimeData` component is responsible for retrieving offline json data and parsing it into `Anime` objects that will be stored in program memory. The `AnimeData` will manage an ArrayList of `Anime` objects providing AniChan with an interface for the program to retrieve with the source data.

The `AnimeData `component:
* can retrieve Anime objects using ID.
* can view detailed  information of each Anime Object.
* can browse the Anime catalog with sorting algorithms.

<br/>

### 3.6 User Component
![User Component Diagram](images/User-Class-Diagram.PNG)
*Figure 7: User Component Diagram*

The User inherits from the abstract `Human` class and stores the name and gender of the user. It represents the user's interaction with `Workspace` class.

The `User`component: 
* can provide user information like `name`, `gender`, and `honorific name`
* Stores an array list of type `Workspace`
* can add, set, and switch between workspaces 

The `Workspace` component:  
* can allow `User` to create and get the list of `Watchlist` and `Bookmark`.
* can allow `User` to change his active `Watchlist`.

<br/>

### 3.7 StorageManager Component
![StorageManager Component Diagram](images/StorageManager-Class-Diagram.png)
*Figure 8: StorageManager Component Diagram*

The `StorageManager` component: 
* can **save** user, watchlist and bookmark data in `.txt` format and **read it back** using 
their respective storage class, `UserStorage`, `WatchlistStorage`, and `BookmarkStorage`.
* can **read** script files that are in `.txt` format using the `ScriptStorage` class.

**AniChan** saved these data as `.txt` files so advanced users will be able to view and manipulate these saved data easily with any available text editor.

## 1. Introduction

AniChan is an all-rounded tool to effectively create and organize anime lists with viewing statistics, efficiency-focused features, and tools to improve anime-watching experience.


## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `AniChan` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.0).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AniChan.
4. Open cmd and change directory into the folder. Run “java -jar anichan.jar”.
5. Type a command into the command prompt and press ‘Enter’ to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing ‘Enter’ will display the help message.


## 3. Features 
**Command Format**

* Commands are case-sensitive.
E.g. Only `help` will work, and so `HELP`, `hElp`, and its other variant will not work.

* Words in UPPERCASE are values that can be supplied by the user.
E.g. in `browse -s SORT_CATEGORY -p PAGE_NUMBER` where SORT_CATEGORY and PAGE_NUMBER are 
parameters that can be used as `browse -s name -o asc`.

* Square brackets indicate optional parameters.
E.g. `browse [-s SORT_CATEGORY]` can be used simply as `browse` or `browse -s name`.
  
* The order of parameters are not important.
E.g. Both `-n USERNAME -dob DATE_FORMAT` and `-dob DATE_FORMAT -n USERNAME` are 
both acceptable and will produce the same output.

In the folder where AniChan is launched, there will be a `data` folder which would contain these data:
* User data is stored in `data/user.txt`.
* Watchlist(s) data are stored in `data/<WORKSPACE-NAME>/watchlist.txt`, e.g. if your workspace is named "AniTranslator",
then the watchlist data can be found in `data/AniTranslator/watchlist.txt`.
* Bookmark(s) data are also stored in the same location as watchlist data, `data/WORKSPACE-NAME/bookmark.txt`.

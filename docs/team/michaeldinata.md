## Overview
AniChan is a desktop application created for anime translators to help efficiently manage their workload and time. It has a wide variety of tools that can help improve
their workflow efficiency and translation accuracy. AniChan is built for fast typists, as such the user will interact with it through a CLI. It is written in Java with almost 14K LOC. 

### Summary of Contributions

#### Enhancements Implemented
I implemented tha ability to add and remove anime from a watchlist, view all the anime in active or a specific watchlist, and also viewing the information of a certain anime.

* What it does: 
    *   The `add` command allows the user to add a specific anime into his active watchlist, and he can also remove an anime from his watchlist using the `remove` command. 
    *   The `view` command allows the user to view all the anime in his active watchlist, or in a specific watchlist that he specifies in the command.
    *   The `info` command allows the user to find out more about a specific anime.

* Justification:
    *   The user may want to keep track of the anime he wants to watch in some sort of list, hence the `add` command enables the users to add the anime he wants to watch into the current watchlist he has. After watching a certain anime, he then wants to remove it from his watchlist, and now the `remove` command will allow him to remove that specific anime from the watchlist.
    *   In the event that the user forgot what anime he wanted to watch, and has added it into his watchlist before, he can use the `view` command to check all the anime he wanted to watch.
    *   The user may also want to find out more details on an anime such as the number of episodes and its release date. The `info` command will provide users with the information that they need.

* Highlights:

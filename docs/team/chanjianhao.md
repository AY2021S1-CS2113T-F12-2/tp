## Overview

AniChan is a desktop application created for anime translators to help efficiently manage their workload and time. It has a wide variety of tools that can help improve their workflow efficacy and translation accuracy. AniChan is built for fast-typists, as such the user will interact with it through a CLI. It is written in Java with almost 14K LOC.

### Summary of Contributions
*   **New Feature:** Added the ability to create `User`.
    *   What it does: On first execution, prompts user for his name and gender to create User profile.
    *   Justification: This feature allows program to know user better so that program may greet user appropriately as part of good user experience we hope to provide.
    *   Highlights: Notably, `User` is a subclass of `Human` abstract class. Other classes such as `Character` and `VoiceActor` inherits Human class as part of our OOP practice when coding AniChan which stores lots of anime data which comes with lots of voice actors and characters. User class contains many interesting methods meant for controlling `Workspace` feature of AniChan.
